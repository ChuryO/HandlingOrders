# HandlingOrders

1. Start app with compile.bat && run.bat
2. On the next step you have to write arguments.


Unfortunately I didn’t turn on compile.sh && ./run.sh because I’m not good at the Linux cmd syntax and couldn’t verify the correctness of the work, however you can run it from the command line.


I assumed that the maven was already installed and registered on the workstation on which the code would run, so I didn’t add it to the Mave project and register it in the PATH.

if this is not the case, then before running the bat files, please write in cmdb: set PATH="[maven_directory]\bin";%PATH%

Thank you.
